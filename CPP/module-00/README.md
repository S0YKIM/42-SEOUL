## 🚩 Instructions (EX01)

Write a program that behaves like a crappy awesome phonebook software.

You have to implement two classes:
- PhoneBook
  - It has an array of contacts.
  - It can store a maximum of 8 contacts. If the user tries to add a 9th contact, replace the oldest one by the new one.
  - Please note that dynamic allocation is forbidden.
- Contact
  - Stands for a phonebook contact.

In your code, the phonebook must be instantiated as an instance of the PhoneBook class.
Same thing for the contacts.
Each one of them must be instantiated as an instance of the Contact class.
You’re free to design the classes as you like but keep in mind that anything that will always be used inside a class is private, and that anything that can be
used outside a class is public.
