# PUSH SWAP

> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.


## ðŸŽ² INSTRUCTIONS

- The game is composed of 2 stacks named a and b.
- To start with:
  - a contains a random number of either positive or negative numbers without any duplicates.
  - b is empty
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.
- To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:

  **`sa`** : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).

  **`sb`** : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).

  **`ss`** : sa and sb at the same time.

  **`pa`** : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.

  **`pb`** : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.

  **`ra`** : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

  **`rb`** : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

  **`rr`** : ra and rb at the same time. rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

  **`rra`** : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

  **`rrb`** : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

  **`rrr`** : rra and rrb at the same time.
