### üö© Mandatory part

You will have to write one program for the mandatory part and one for the bonus part but they will have the same basic rules:

- This project is to be coded in C, following the Norm. Any leak, crash, undefined
  behavior, or norm error means 0 to the project.
- Several philosophers are sitting at a round table doing one of three things: eating,
  thinking, or sleeping.
- While eating, they are not thinking or sleeping, while sleeping, they are not eating
  or thinking and of course, while thinking, they are not eating or sleeping.
- The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
- There are some forks on the table.
- As spaghetti is difficult to serve and eat with a single fork, it is assumed that a
  philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.
- The philosophers must never be starving.
- Every philosopher needs to eat.
- Philosophers don‚Äôt speak with each other.
- Philosophers don‚Äôt know when another philosopher is about to die.
- Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping.
- When a philosopher is done sleeping, he will start thinking.
- The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
- Each program should have the same options: number_of_philosophers time_to_die
  time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
  - number_of_philosophers: is the number of philosophers and also the number
    of forks
  - time_to_die: is in milliseconds, if a philosopher doesn‚Äôt start eating ‚Äôtime_to_die‚Äô
    milliseconds after starting his last meal or the beginning of the simulation, it
    dies
  - time_to_eat: is in milliseconds and is the time it takes for a philosopher to
    eat. During that time he will need to keep the two forks.
  - time_to_sleep: is in milliseconds and is the time the philosopher will spend
    sleeping.
  - number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat: argument is optional, if all
    philosophers eat at least ‚Äônumber_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat‚Äô the
    simulation will stop. If not specified, the simulation will stop only at the death
    of a philosopher.
- Each philosopher should be given a number from 1 to ‚Äônumber_of_philosophers‚Äô.
- Philosopher number 1 is next to philosopher number ‚Äônumber_of_philosophers‚Äô.
  Any other philosopher with the number N is seated between philosopher N - 1 and
  philosopher N + 1
- Any change of status of a philosopher must be written as follows (with X replaced
  with the philosopher number and timestamp_in_ms the current timestamp in milliseconds)
  - timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
  - timestamp_in_ms X is eating
  - timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
  - timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
  - timestamp_in_ms X died
- The status printed should not be scrambled or intertwined with another philosopher‚Äôs status.
- You can‚Äôt have more than 10 ms between the death of a philosopher and when it will print its death.
- Again, philosophers should avoid dying!

In this version the specific rules are:

- One fork between each philosopher, therefore if they are multiple philosophers, there will be a fork at the right and the left of each philosopher.
- To avoid philosophers duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them.
- Each philosopher should be a thread

In this version the specific rules are:

- All the forks are in the middle of the table.
- They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by a semaphore.
- Each philosopher should be a process and the main process should not be a philosopher.
